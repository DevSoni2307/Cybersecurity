# Cybersecurity

My name is Dev Nileshkumar Soni(25BBS0039)

I want to join WhiteHats because it gives me a good opportunity to learn more about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and how to protect systems from online threats. Being part of WhiteHats will help me improve my technical skills, gain practical knowledge, and work with others who are interested in security and technology. It will also help me grow personally and professionally in this field.

One recent cybersecurity incident I read about was a major data breach where hackers leaked users’ personal information from a popular online platform. The attackers accessed email IDs, passwords, and other sensitive data due to weak security measures. This incident showed how important strong security practices and awareness are to protect user data.
